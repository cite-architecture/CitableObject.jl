# Utilties for working with CEX data: the `CexUtils` module



CEX is a plain-text format for organizing citable data.  As a file format, CEX does not specify what kinds of URN values may be used to identify scholarly resources.  The generically applicable `Cite2Urn` can be used to identify the contents of citable collections and sets of relations among citable resources.  The `CexUtils` submodule provides utilities for filtering and extracting content from CEX sources identified by `Cite2Urn`s.
